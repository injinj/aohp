## Why AOHP?

Traditional OS puts apps at the center. Users navigate **developer-defined app interfaces** to do everything, which may be tedious and distracting.

AOHP shifts the OS toward deeper personalization.
It introduces **user-defined apps**, which are generated based on the user's actual needs and are backed by AI agents under the hood.
The agents use system APIs, CLIs and GUI-based apps in the background to compose actual services.

To make such experience **feasible, efficient and secure**. Many components in the system and framework layers have to be redesigned, but not all. That's why we introduce AOHP, an OS-level agent harness to enable personalized, efficient and secure interaction.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **AOHP is an early-stage research prototype**.
> It is not ready for production deployments or security-critical workloads.
>
> We will keep improving the reliability, compatibility, and security coverage.
> Feedback and contributions are welcome.

## Design

AOHP features a set of efficient agent interfaces and a secure information flow tracking mechanism, which together foster the core capabilities to enable personalized service composition. The system architecture:

A comparison between AOHP and stock Android:

| Dimension               | Stock Android                                                 | AOHP                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Interaction Model**   | Users operate app-defined workflows directly                  | Agents act as first-class OS actors under user intent         |
| **Interaction Surface** | Fixed app GUIs defined by developers                          | Personalized service entrances mediated by agents             |
| **Process Execution**   | Single-tenant foreground execution bound to physical displays | Parallel background interaction decoupled from the screen     |
| **System Memory**       | Fragmented and locked inside individual applications          | OS-managed cross-app memory for task personalization          |
| **Security & Privacy**  | Coarse-grained app permissions and opaque data flows          | Fine-grained data-flow tracking and sandboxed sensitive values|

## 🎬 Demos

AOHP ships as a runnable AOSP fork.
The recordings below come from the compiled system image.

### User-Defined Apps

Given a natural-language prompt, AOHP produces a fully-functional app, including the frontend UI and background logic supported by agents.

### Agent Execution

AOHP provides personalized services by orchestrating APIs, CLIs, GUIs, memory, skills, etc. with AI agents.

## Evaluation Highlights

We evaluate AOHP with [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) against stock Android.
The benchmark has 30 real-world mobile tasks.
They cover GUI operation, non-GUI operation, event capture, multi-source retrieval, memory management, and hybrid workflows.

### Task Completion

Each task is scored by objective checkpoints, so partially completed tasks still receive partial credit.

| Setting | Completion Rate | Fully Solved | Partially Completed |
| ------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| OpenClaw on stock Android | 54.44% | 13 / 30 | 7 / 30 |
| OpenClaw on AOHP | **75.56%** | **20 / 30** | 5 / 30 |
| Gain | **+21.12%** | **+7 tasks** | - |


### Execution Cost

To compare cost fairly, we report the 11 tasks that both systems solve completely.

| Setting | Tool Calls | Duration | Tokens | LLM Requests |
| ------- | ---------- | -------- | ------ | ------------ |
| OpenClaw on stock Android | 233 | 33.94 min | 7.10M | 273 |
| OpenClaw on AOHP | **129** | **18.93 min** | **3.44M** | **143** |
| Reduction | **44.64%** | **44.21%** | **51.55%** | **47.62%** |

### Information-Flow Security

AOHP is also evaluated with security-oriented test cases.
The system enforces all five policy cases:

| Security Check | Result |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Sensitive display uses vault references, not plaintext | Pass |
| Ordinary non-sensitive actions proceed without extra approval | Pass |
| Sensitive transfers and payment confirmation require user consent | Pass |
| Unsupported access fails closed | Pass |
| Sensitive events are redacted and preserve taint metadata | Pass |

## Getting Started

AOHP is built on AOSP. This repository hosts project documentation and the unified development framework.
Source trees live in the `aohp-os` GitHub organization and are pulled in via [local_manifests](https://github.com/aohp-os/local_manifests).

### Quick start

```bash
# 1. Clone the dev framework
git clone git@github.com:aohp-os/aohp.git
cd aohp

# 2. Initialize AOSP + AOHP manifests (Android 16 QPR2; see guide for mirror/proxy options)
cd AOSP && repo init -b android16-qpr2-release
cd .repo && git clone git@github.com:aohp-os/local_manifests.git && cd ..
repo sync -j4

# 3. Build
bash scripts/build.sh

# 4. Launch Cuttlefish (after envsetup + lunch)
source AOSP/build/envsetup.sh
lunch aosp_cf_x86_64_phone_aohp-trunk_staging-userdebug
sudo -E bash -c 'ulimit -n 65536; '"$ANDROID_HOST_OUT"'/bin/launch_cvd --report_anonymous_usage_stats=n' &
```

Open the emulator at **https://localhost:8443/**.

### Full development guide

Setup, networking, multi-instance Cuttlefish, sandbox options, and contribution workflow are documented in **[Development Guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)**.

You can also clone this repo for project overview and updates:
